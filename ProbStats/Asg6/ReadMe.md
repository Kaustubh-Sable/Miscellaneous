This directory contains the code written for calculating regression fit and the Residual sum of squares for given data.

Here is the formal question:

**More on Regression and Time series analysis**

In this problem, we use the data from Azure trace; refer to q4.dat dataset on the website. The file
contains 576 values. Each value represents the number of VMs running in a data center for a 5 minutes
interval. Thus, the data spans exactly 2 days.

Split the dataset into 4 equal parts. For each quarter of the data, using simple linear regression
(include Î²0 term), plot the original data and the regression fit (using the corresponding quarter of
data as training), and calculate the SSE in all 4 cases.
